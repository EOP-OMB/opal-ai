# opal-ai

This project aims to develop a plug-in to OPAL (https://github.com/eop-omb/opal) that can automate the process of auditing system documentation to identify how specific security controls are implemented. The use case is:

As a cybersecurity officer, I want to be able to analyze the user-oriented documentation for a system and output concise descriptions of how specific security controls are implemented. These descriptions should be sufficient for an auditor to validate that the system meets the control requirements.
