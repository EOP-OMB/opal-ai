# EPA Policy Example 
The documents in this folder are from https://www.epa.gov/irmpoli8/information-security-policy-procedures-and-standards and contain agency-wide policies written directly against the NIST SP 800-53 standard.

Because of the volume of documentation, this will serve as a good "needle-in-the-haystack" test for key word (vector-based) search of document segments in a retrieval-augmented generation database.

In addition, it will serve as a clear test of our ability to match 800-53 controls and extract properties (the variables in the controls) from the text.
