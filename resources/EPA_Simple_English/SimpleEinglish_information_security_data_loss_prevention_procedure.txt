# Information Security – Data Loss Prevention Procedure  
**Directive No: CIO 2150-P-24.1**

**1. PURPOSE**  
The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014 requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Chief Information Officer (CIO) to make sure there are rules in place to keep agency information secure. This means protecting the confidentiality (keeping information private), integrity (keeping information accurate), and availability (making sure information can be accessed when needed) of the data. EPA information is classified by sensitivity and protection needs, and steps are taken to prevent the unauthorized sharing or leaking of information.

**2. SCOPE**  
This procedure applies to all EPA information and systems, including those managed by contractors or other agencies working for the EPA.

**3. AUDIENCE**  
This procedure is relevant for Senior Information Officials (SIO), Information Security Officers (ISO), System Owners (SO), Service Managers (SM), EPA employees, contractors, and anyone using EPA information and systems.

**4. AUTHORITY**  
This directive is issued by the EPA CIO under Delegation 1-19. It follows several laws and regulations related to information security, including the E-Government Act of 2002, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Improvement Act of 2016, FISMA of 2014, and others.
