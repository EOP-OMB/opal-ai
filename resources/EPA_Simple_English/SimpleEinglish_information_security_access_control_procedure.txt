### Purpose

This procedure helps the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) follow security control requirements to manage access to information and systems. These requirements are based on guidelines from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

---

### Scope

These procedures apply to all EPA information and systems, whether managed by the EPA or by contractors and other organizations on behalf of the EPA.

---

### Audience

This document is meant for Senior Information Officials (SIO), Information Security Officers (ISO), System Owners (SO), Service Managers (SM), EPA employees, contractors, and anyone who uses EPA information and systems.

---

### Background

The EPA must ensure all offices meet minimum-security standards defined in Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) Publication 200. All EPA information systems must follow the security controls defined in NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5.

---

### Authority

The legal background for these procedures includes several laws and standards:
- Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) of 2014
- OMB Circular A-130
- FIPS 200
- EPA Information Security Policy
- EPA Roles and Responsibilities Procedures

---

### Procedure

Senior Information Officials, Information Security Officers, System Owners, and Service Managers are responsible for implementing these controls. EPA employees, contractors, and users must follow the directions provided by these officials.

#### Key Controls:
1. **Account Management**:
   - Define and document types of accounts allowed and prohibited.
   - Assign account managers.
   - Specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations.
   - Require approvals for account creation.
   - Monitor account use.
   - Notify managers of account changes within specified timelines.
   - Review accounts every 60 days for compliance.
   - Align account management processes with personnel changes.

2. **Automated Account Management**:
   - Support account management using automated systems.
   - Remove temporary accounts immediately after use.
   - Disable accounts after expiration or inactivity.
   - Audit account actions automatically.
   - Log out users after 30 minutes of inactivity or at the end of work periods.

3. **Access Enforcement**:
   - Enforce access rules based on authorization policies.
   - Ensure privacy controls for accessing personal information.

4. **Information Flow Enforcement**:
   - Control information flow within and between systems.
   - Decrypt information to prevent unauthorized bypassing of security measures.

5. **Separation of Duties**:
   - Document roles to support separation of duties.
   - Define system access authorizations.

6. **Least Privilege**:
   - Allow only necessary access for users to complete tasks.
   - Require non-privileged accounts for non-security functions.
   - Review privileges quarterly and log privileged functions.

7. **Unsuccessful Logon Attempts**:
   - Limit to 5 invalid logon attempts in15 minutes and lock account for 30 minutes after.
    
8. **System Use Notifications**:
   - Display a system use notification before granting access.
   - Maintain a visible notification message until users take explicit action to log on.

9. **Concurrent Session Control**:
   - Limit the number of concurrent sessions.

10. **Device Lock**:
   - Lock devices after 15 minutes of inactivity.
   - Use public images to conceal information on locked devices.

11. **Session Termination**:
   - Terminate user sessions after 90 minutes of inactivity.

12. **Remote Access**:
   - Document and authorize remote access requests.
   - Monitor and control remote access and ensure encryption is used.

13. **Wireless Access**:
   - Establish requirements for wireless access and authorize each type.
   - Use encryption for wireless access authentication.
   - Disable wireless networking when not in use.

14. **Access Control for Mobile Devices**:
   - Implement encryption on all mobile devices.

15. **Use of External Systems**:
   - Establish terms for accessing systems from external devices.
   - Permit use of external systems only after verification of security controls.
   - Restrict use of portable storage devices to authorized individuals.

16. **Information Sharing**:
   - Ensure access authorizations match information use restrictions.

17. **Publicly Accessible Content**:
   - Designate authorized individuals to make information publicly accessible.
   - Train individuals to prevent non-public information from being shared.
