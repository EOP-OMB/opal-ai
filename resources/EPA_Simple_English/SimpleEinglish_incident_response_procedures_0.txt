# IT/IM DIRECTIVE PROCEDURE

Issued by the EPA Chief Information Officer, following Delegation 1-19

---

## 1. PURPOSE
This guide helps explain how the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) handles security incidents, which are issues or attacks on information systems. It's based on rules from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

## 2. SCOPE
These rules cover all information and systems used by the EPA. This includes systems managed or operated by others on behalf of the EPA, such as contractors or other agencies.

## 3. AUDIENCE
The people who need to follow these rules include Senior Information Officials (SIO), Information Security Officers (ISO), EPA System Owners (SO), Service Managers (SM), and everyone using EPA information, such as employees and contractors.

## 4. BACKGROUND
The EPA must follow certain security rules for all its offices. These rules are described in a document called FIPS Publication 200. The EPA makes sure all information systems meet security requirements by applying controls from another document called NIST SP 800-53, Revision 5.

## 5. AUTHORITY
This guide is based on several laws and policies, including:
- The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014
- OMB Memorandum M-06-19 (which talks about reporting incidents involving personal information)
- FIPS 200 (which outlines minimum security standards)
- EPA’s own security policies

## 6. PROCEDURE
Various officials like SIOs, ISOs, and SOs, along with Service Managers, must make sure these security procedures are followed. They need to create and follow a plan for putting these rules into action. EPA employees and contractors should know and follow these rules as directed.

The procedures are grouped under different categories identified by NIST. Here are some key highlights:

### Incident Response Training
Everyone gets training within 30 days of starting their role or getting system access, when systems change, and every year after that. This training helps them know what to do during incidents.

### Simulated Events
For high-level systems, training includes practice scenarios to better prepare for real-life incidents.

### Automated Training
High-level systems have training environments with automated tools to help simulate incidents.

### Incident Response Testing
Testing for incident response capabilities happens every year. Methods include checklists, walk-throughs, and table-top exercises.

### Incident Handling
All systems must have a plan that covers preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery from incidents. These plans should learn from past incidents and coordinate with other planning activities.

### Incident Monitoring
All incidents are tracked and documented, with high-level systems using automated systems for data collection and analysis.

### Incident Reporting
People must report suspected incidents within one hour and share details with the Computer Security Incident Response Capability (CSIRC) and local ISOs.

### Incident Response Assistance
There is a support resource to help users handle and report incidents.

### Incident Response Plan
Each system needs an incident response plan describing how to handle incidents, what metrics to use, and who is responsible. This plan must be updated when there are changes and protected from unauthorized access.
