## Simplified English Versions of EPA Policy Documentation

This version of policy documents were created to test the control detection workflow's ability to find evidence within a library that does not directly match the NIST 800-53 control text. They were generated using the GPT-4o model with the prompt:

The above text is from a pdf. Can you please rewrite it for an audience 
that reads at a high school level?  If possible, please include all details, 
but feel free to drop the NIST 800-53 codes ("CA-5", "IR-7(1)", etc.).  
Thank you!
