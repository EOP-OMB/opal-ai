**Key Procedures:**

1. **Event Logging:**
   - Identify events the system can log to support auditing.
   - Coordinate logging with other entities needing audit information.
   - Update logged events regularly or when significant changes occur.

2. **Content of Audit Records:**
   - Ensure audit records clearly show what happened, when, and where.
   - For higher-risk systems, include more detailed information like specific protocols used.

3. **Storing Audit Logs:**
   - Allocate enough storage for audit logs to meet EPA retention requirements.
   - Warn administrators if storage is nearly full.

4. **Audit Log Failures:**
   - Alert administrators immediately if there’s a logging failure.
   - Take corrective actions like overwriting old logs or shutting down the system if logs can’t be offloaded.

5. **Reviewing Audit Records:**
   - Review and analyze logs weekly for any signs of inappropriate or unusual activity.
   - Report suspicious activities to relevant personnel immediately.

6. **Audit Record Production and Protection:**
   - Use internal clocks to timestamp logs.
   - Protect audit records from unauthorized access or changes.
   - Store logs separately from the systems being audited.

7. **Non-Repudiation:**
   - Ensure audit records can irrefutably show who performed specific actions.

8. **Retaining Audit Records:**
   - Keep audit records as per EPA retention schedules, ensuring they support after-the-fact investigations.
