  <CONTROL_SATISFACTION_RATIONAL>Based on the evidence provided in the policy documents, the control RA-5 is addressed by the policy documents. The policy specifies the required frequency for vulnerability scans, the response times for remediating vulnerabilities, and the personnel or roles with whom the vulnerability information should be shared. Additionally, the policy mentions employing vulnerability monitoring tools and techniques, analyzing vulnerability scan reports, and updating the vulnerabilities to be scanned.</CONTROL_SATISFACTION_RATIONAL>
