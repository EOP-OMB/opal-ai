Evidence for the control MP-8 Media Downgrading:


1. **Document Name**: ../resources/EPA_Simple_English/SimpleEinglish_information_security_assessment_authorization_and_monitoring_procedure.txt  
   **Section Number/Identifier**: Not specifically numbered, but includes procedures related to assessments and controls.  
   **Quote of the Evidence**: “Check the system's controls to ensure they work correctly and meet required security and privacy standards.” (This implies that the downgrading process would be assessed as part of the controls in place.)


2. **Document Name**: ../resources/EPA_Simple_English/SimpleEnglish_information_security_maintenance_procedure.txt  
   **Section Number/Identifier**: 6. Procedure  
   **Quote of the Evidence**: “Remove sensitive information from equipment before off-site maintenance.” (This indicates a process that may relate to downgrading media before it is handled elsewhere.)


3. **Document Name**: ../resources/EPA_Simple_English/SimpleEnglish_information_security_access_control_procedure.txt  
   **Section Number/Identifier**: Definitions  
   **Quote of the Evidence**: “Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Sensitive information that isn't classified but still needs protection.” (While not directly addressing downgrading, it underscores the importance of handling sensitive information properly.)


4. **Document Name**: ../resources/EPA_Simple_English/SimpleEnglish_information_security_maintenance_procedure.txt  
   **Section Number/Identifier**: Additional Steps for High-Security Systems  
   **Quote of the Evidence**: “Sanitize or remove sensitive components before maintenance.” (This relates to ensuring that sensitive information is downgraded or properly handled prior to any maintenance activities.)


5. **Document Name**: ../resources/EPA_Simple_English/SimpleEnglish_information_security_maintenance_procedure.txt  
   **Section Number/Identifier**: For Nonlocal Maintenance  
   **Quote of the Evidence**: “Use strong authentication for remote sessions.” (This suggests a process in place that may relate to the verification of information security when downgrading media or sensitive information.)


While there are no explicit statements about a specific media downgrading process (as outlined in MP-8), these quotes indicate that there are related procedures and considerations for handling sensitive information and controls that suggest the presence of an overarching process for media downgrading in practice. However, the evidence may be considered weak due to the lack of a clearly defined media downgrading procedure specific to MP-8.

Final Answer:


1. **Property**: [Assignment: organization-defined system media downgrading process]  
   **Quote from Evidence**: “Check the system's controls to ensure they work correctly and meet required security and privacy standards.”  
   **Value of the Property**: The evidence implies that a process for assessing the effectiveness of controls, which may include media downgrading, is in place; however, it does not explicitly define the downgrading process.


2. **Property**: [Assignment: organization-defined system media downgrading process]  
   **Quote from Evidence**: “Remove sensitive information from equipment before off-site maintenance.”  
   **Value of the Property**: This suggests a procedure related to the downgrading of media, indicating that a practice exists for handling sensitive information, though it lacks specificity regarding a formal downgrading process.


3. **Property**: [Assignment: organization-defined system media requiring downgrading]  
   **Quote from Evidence**: “Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI): Sensitive information that isn't classified but still needs protection.”  
   **Value of the Property**: The reference to CUI indicates the type of information that may require downgrading, although it does not explicitly identify specific media that require this process.


4. **Property**: [Assignment: organization-defined system media downgrading process]  
   **Quote from Evidence**: “Sanitize or remove sensitive components before maintenance.”  
   **Value of the Property**: This indicates a practice similar to media downgrading, but again lacks a clear, defined process specific to MP-8.


5. **Property**: [Assignment: organization-defined system media downgrading process]  
   **Quote from Evidence**: “Use strong authentication for remote sessions.”  
   **Value of the Property**: This suggests a verification mechanism that may relate to ensuring security during media downgrading, but does not specifically address downgrading processes.


**Conclusion**: While several pieces of evidence suggest related practices for handling sensitive information, the documentation lacks explicit statements outlining a defined media downgrading process as required by MP-8. Therefore, the control is not fully satisfied due to incomplete and vague references rather than a clear, actionable downgrading policy.


Control Addressed: No. The evidence does not sufficiently establish the presence of a defined media downgrading process or specific identification of media requiring downgrading, as mandated by NIST SP 800-53 control MP-8.
